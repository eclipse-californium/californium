# Please provide basic issue information

Issues may be answered much faster, if you provide more details ahead!

In the last years, especially two kind of issues consumed a lot of our time, and it will be really much faster, if you provide therefore this information **ahead**.

## Issue type 1:

Californium is used together with an other CoAP/DTLS implementation. Please provide, where you run Californium (client or server side) and which other implementation you use. Even, if the other implementation is a proprietary one, it is important to know, that it is not Californium. Without traces and captures in the very most cases we can not help you. So please really consider to provide that all ahead! And, please captures, no pictures!

## Issue type 2:

Network environment, e.g. k8s, docker, NATs, firewalls, virtual machines. All that may apply unaware changes to your traffic and may result in failures. In some cases it is also interesting to other users, if such issues occurs. So, still please report them. But the most of them can not be fixed in Californium, they must be fixed in that network environment. Therefore it is very important, that you list all the used components. In order to ensure, that it is no Californium issue, we kindly ask you to verify, that the issue doesn't occur, if a simple network environment is used (e.g. running in two raspberry PIs).

## Information ahead to speed up the processing of issues:

* branch/release your faced the issue. Currently
    * (1.0 is a previous release, usually no bugfixes are applied)
    * (1.1 is the previous master, no plans to continue this)
    * 2.7.x is the last previous major release
    * and master is the development branch include the current major release 3.x.y
* If you use a SNAPSHOT, ensure your updated to the latest. Please provide the commit your using
* If your issue is related to a combination with other implementations, please mention that implementation (including proprietary ones). And the sides your using it, client or server.
* If your issue is related to your own snippet, please provide that
