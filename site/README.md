# Californium Web Site

This is the source code for generating the Californium website hosted at https://eclipse.org/californium.
It uses Syna theme and Hugo with two simple pages, one for landing and one for the community page.

## Prerequisites
- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).
- [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). Depending on your system, this might require Scoop, Choclatey, or other software.

## Installation

Before you are able to build the website, you need to update its git submodules (Syna theme is added as a submodule).

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Usage

To start start the website run the following commands:

**Development**:
```
$ hugo server -D # This command starts the Hugo server and watches the site directory for changes.
```

**Production**:
```
$ hugo # This command generates the static website in the public/ directory. If you do not have a site, then it gives errors about missing layout files.
```

> Prerequisites: Go, Hugo

## Directory Structure

We're using the standard directory structure using content pages.

```
├─ content/
|  └ _global/ # All global fragments are located in this directory
|  └ _index/ # Landing page is in this directory and it's url is changed to **/**.
|  └ community/ # Community page
├ layouts/ # contains additional and overridden layout files
├ static/ # Your static files are in this directory.
├ themes/ # Hugo uses this directory as a default to look for themes. Syna theme is a git submodule available in this directory.
├ .gitignore
├ .gitmodules
├ config.toml # Hugo config file containing general settings and menu configs.
```

For storing images in the static directory, note that Syna fragments look for
images in their own fragment directory, page directory and `static/images`
directory. Read our [image fallthrough documentation](https://syna.okkur.org/docs/image-fallthrough/) for more info.
