The element-connector abstracts from the different transports CoAP can use.
It provides the basic UDPConnector as well as the interface to implement new connectors like the DtlsConnector of Scandium.

It is also the place for common components and utilities, e.g to read certificate based credentials.
Since version 3.0 this includes also the new configuration.
