For cloud-VMs, using [cloudinit](https://github.com/eclipse/californium/tree/master/demo-apps/cf-unix-setup#cloud-init---automatic-cloud-vm-installation) makes the installation even easier. Finally, [install scripts](https://github.com/eclipse/californium/tree/master/demo-apps/cf-unix-setup#installation-on-exoscale-cloud) are provided, which enables you to start your own server within minutes.
