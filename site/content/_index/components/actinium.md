Actinium (Ac) is the app-server for Californium to realize IoT mashups! Your JavaScript apps become available as RESTful resources and can directly talk to IoT devices using our CoapRequest object API.

(Note: the JavaScript support has changed since java 11. Actinium has not been updated for java versions newer than java 8.)
