Eclipse Californium is a Java implementation of [RFC7252 - Constrained Application Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252) for IoT Cloud services. Thus, the focus is on scalability and usability instead of resource-efficiency
like for embedded devices. Yet Californium is also suitable for embedded JVMs.

and [http://coap.technology/](http://coap.technology/).

# Build using Maven

You need to have a working maven installation to build Californium.
Then simply run the following from the project's root directory:

```sh
$ mvn clean install
```

Executable JARs of the examples with all dependencies can be found in the `demo-apps/run` folder.

# Using Californium in Maven Projects

We are publishing Californium's artifacts for milestones and releases to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ccalifornium).
To use the latest released version as a library in your projects, add the following dependency
to your `pom.xml` (without the dots):

```xml
  <dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
            <groupId>org.eclipse.californium</groupId>
            <artifactId>californium-core</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.6</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
  </dependencies>
  ...
```

If you want to give the most recent milestone a try, use version `2.0.0-M11` instead.

Please Note: in the meantime, a lot of new bugfixes and improvements has been made in branch 2.0.x, which had affected the API and could not be back-ported to the other branches. Even if 2.0.x is still under development, we recommend to focus on using the 2.0.x branch, especially for larger changes.

##### Current Builds

You can also be bold and try out the most recent build from `2.0.x`.
However, we are not publishing those to Maven Central but to Californium's project repository at Eclipse only.
You will therefore need to add the Eclipse Repository to your `pom.xml` first:

```
  <repositories>
    ...
    <repository>
      <id>repo.eclipse.org</id>
      <name>Californium Repository</name>
      <url>https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/californium/</url>
    </repository>
    ...
  </repositories>
```
You can then simply depend on `2.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.
 
# Eclipse

The project can be easily imported into a recent version of the Eclipse IDE.
Make sure to have the following before importing the Californium (Cf) projects:

* [Eclipse EGit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/) (should be the case with every recent Eclipse version)
* [m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/) (should be the case with every recent Eclipse version)
* UTF-8 workspace text file encoding (Preferences &raquo; General &raquo; Workspace)

Then choose *[Import... &raquo; Maven &raquo; Existing Maven Projects]* to import `californium` into Eclipse.

# IntelliJ

The project can also be imported to IntelliJ as follows:

In IntelliJ, choose *[File.. &raquo; Open]* then select the location of the cloned repository in your filesystem. IntelliJ will then automatically import all projects and resolve required Maven dependencies.

# Interop Server

A test server is running at <a href="coap://californium.eclipse.org:5683/">coap://californium.eclipse.org:5683/</a>.
It is an instance of the `cf-plugtest-server` from the demo-apps.
The root resource responds with its current version.
More information can be found at [http://californium.eclipse.org/](http://californium.eclipse.org/).

Another interop server with a different implementation can be found at
[coap://coap.me:5683/](coap://coap.me:5683/).
