Class descriptions
The following paragraphs briefly describes the classes that represents OSCORE.

OSCoreCoapStackFactory
Extends the CoapStackFactory to provide and set the OSCoreStack.

OSCoreCtx
Implements the OSCore context, sequence numbering checking and nonce generation.

HashMapCtxDB
Implements the interface OSCoreCtxBD by using HashMaps for storage, thus it contains getters and setters for different kinds of circumstances.

OSCoreStack
Extends BaseCoapStack. Creates a new stack for UDP as the transport. It will contain the following layers: ExchangeCleanupLayer, ObserveLayer, BlockwiseLayer, ReliabilityLayer, ObjectSecurityLayer and OuterBlockwiseLayer.

ObjectSecurityLayer
Extends AbstractLayer. This class knits together the functionality of OSCore, i.e. decides if a request or response is sound (the presence of a OSCore option is necessary), only encrypts proper requests and only decrypts proper responses. Responsible to determine if a message is of OSCore or not. If any errors occur or if there is anything strange about the message, processing will terminate and the OSExceptionHandler will receive the thrown OSException. The OSException will decide if a reply is sent back to the sender.

RequestEncryptor
Extends Encryptor. Decides what to serialize. Encrypts and compresses requests, also increments the sequence number.

RequestDecryptor
Extends Decryptor. Decrypts and decompresses requests. Decides what to serialize. Also, manages outer observe options properly, thus it doesn’t get lost.

ResponseEncryptor
Extends Encryptor. Decides what to serialize. Encrypts and compresses responses, which includes managing sequence number in the case of observe.

ResponseDecryptor
Extends Decryptor. Serializes, decrypts and decompresses requests, which includes managing sequence number.

OSSerializer
Serializes and reads options bases on the situation (i.e. request or response). Also, creates the Additional Authenticated Data (AAD). 

OSExceptionHandler
Centralized exception handling. Creates the correct behavior when it is given an OSException.

OSException
Extends Exception. Implements a throwable exception during OSCore processing.

ByteId
Implements identification for byte arrays. Since, the hashcode method for a byte array is dependent of sequencing, thus equality checks are not working as we want.

OptionJuggle
Handler for Option management.

HelloWorld example
Displays the basic behavior of the OSCore system, i.e. initiating contexts, adding contexts, initiating client and server, which input values are necessary, how to implement and create resources on the server. Run server and then client to test the HelloWorld example.
