/**
 * A container for a set of DTLS records that are to be (re-)transmitted as a
 * whole on a DTLS connection.
 * 
 * DTLS messages are grouped into a series of message flights. One flight
 * consists of at least one message and needs to be re-transmitted until the
 * peer's next flight has arrived in its total. A flight needs not only consist
 * of {@code HandshakeMessage}s but may also contain {@code AlertMessage}s and
 * {@code ChangeCipherSpecMessage}s. See
 * <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347#section-4.2.4">RFC 6347</a> for
 * details.
 * 
 * Scandium offers also the possibility to stop the retransmission with
 * receiving the first response message instead of the complete fight. That is
 * currently configurable using
 * {@link DtlsConnectorConfig#isEarlyStopRetransmission()}. Only for the flight
 * before the very last flight of a handshake, it must be ensured, that the
 * retransmission is only stopped, after that very last flight is received
 * completely. Though the very last flight in DTLS 1.2 is always a flight with
 * CCS and FINISH, the implementation just use message of type handshake to stop
 * the retransmissions.
 * 
 * Even with stopped retransmission, a flight may timeout a handshake, if the
 * handshake response could not received completely. That timeout with stopped
 * retransmission is implemented using the timeout of the current try/retry and
 * the timeout used for the retry, when the maximum number of retries is
 * reached.
 * 
 * To support both variants, the flight provides the {@link #responseStarted}
 * and {@link #responseCompleted} flags and a general handle to a timeout task.
 * 
 * @see e-mail discussion IETF TLS mailarchive, 2017, May 31. - June 1., Simone
 *      Bernard and Raja Ashok
