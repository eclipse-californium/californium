/**
 * An in-memory <code>ConnectionStore</code> with a configurable maximum capacity
 * and support for evicting stale connections based on a <em>least recently used</em> policy.
 * 
 * The store keeps track of the connections' last-access time automatically.
 * Every time a connection is read from or put to the store the access-time
 * is updated.
 * 
 * A connection can be successfully added to the store if any of the
 * following conditions is met:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The store's remaining capacity is greater than zero.</li>
 * <li>The store contains at least one <em>stale</em> connection, i.e. a
 * connection that has not been accessed for at least the store's <em>
 * connection expiration threshold</em> period. In such a case the least
 * recently accessed stale connection gets evicted from the store to make
 * place for the new connection to be added.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * This implementation uses a <code>java.util.HashMap</code> with
 * a connection's peer address as key as its backing store.
 * In addition to that the store keeps a doubly-linked list of the
 * connections in access-time order.
 * 
 * Insertion, lookup and removal of connections is done in
 * <em>O(log n)</em>.
 * 
 * Storing and reading to/from the store is thread safe.
