/**
 * An in-memory <code>SessionStore</code> with a maximum capacity
 * and support for evicting stale sessions based on an LRU policy.
 * 
 * The store keeps track of the sessions' last-access time automatically.
 * Every time a session is read from or put to the store, the access-time
 * is updated.
 * 
 * A session can be successfully added to the store if any of the
 * following conditions is met:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The store's remaining capacity is greater than zero.</li>
 * <li>The store contains at least one <em>stale</em> session, i.e. a
 * session that has not been accessed for at least the store's <em>
 * session expiration threshold</em> period. In such a case the least-
 * recently accessed stale session gets evicted from the store to make
 * place for the new session to be added.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * This implementation uses a <code>java.util.HashMap</code> with
 * a session's peer address as key as its backing store.
 * In addition to that the store keeps a doubly-linked list of the
 * sessions in access-time order.
 * 
 * Insertion, lookup and removal of sessions is done in
 * <em>O(log n)</em>.
