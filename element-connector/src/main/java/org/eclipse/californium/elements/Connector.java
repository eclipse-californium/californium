/**
 * A managed interface for exchanging messages between networked clients and a
 * server application.
 * 
 * An implementation usually binds to a socket on a local network interface in order
 * to communicate with clients. After the {@link #start()} method has been invoked,
 * applications can use the {@link #send(RawData)} method to send messages
 * (wrapped in a {@link RawData} object) to a client via the network. Processing of
 * messages received from clients is delegated to the handler registered via the
 * {@link #setRawDataReceiver(RawDataChannel)} method.
 * 
 * Implementations of the {@link #send(RawData)} method should be non-blocking
 * to allow the server application to continue working on other tasks. This could
 * be achieved by buffering outbound messages in a queue and off-loading the sending
 * of messages via the network to a separate <code>Thread</code>.
