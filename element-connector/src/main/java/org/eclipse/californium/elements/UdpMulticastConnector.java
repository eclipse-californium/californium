/**
 * {@link Connector} which inherits functionality of {@link UDPConnector}
 * replacing DatagramSocket with a MulticastSocket to receive multicast requests
 * in compliance to RFC7390 Group Communication for the Constrained Application
 * Protocol (CoAP) to the registered multicast group.
 * <p>
 * Note: since 2.3, a connector joining only one multicast group, maybe used as
 * "multicast receiver". In that case the {@link #getAddress()} will return this
 * multicast group. If configured as broadcast receiver, it could also be used
 * as "multicast receiver".
 * 
 * This enables to setup systems, which listen on different ports for multicast
 * than respond on unicast. It allows to host multiple coap-multicast-server to
 * be hosted on the same peer.

 * <p>
 * To setup a system, which listens on the same port for unicast and multicast,
 * and reliable distinguishs between them, seems to be not too easy with java.
 * Generally try to omit to use the "any" address at any place. Neither for the
 * unicast socket nor the multicast bind-address. For IPv6 - multicast with
 * link-scope, this may fail caused by
 * <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8210493">Bind to node- or
 * linklocal ipv6 multicast address fails</a>. Please always check your server
 * logs for messages of the pattern "received request {} via different multicast
 * groups ({} != {})!". That indicates, that the multicast request is accidently
 * received by multiple sockets and so unicast request may not be reliable
 * distinguished.

 * Note: using the multicast address as bind address may work as mention in the
