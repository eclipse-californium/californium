# TeamMulticast-CoAP-PubSub
This was part of Multicast team's project for the course II1305 at KTH.

The goal of the project is to implement the IETS's RFC for CoAP publish-subscribe as an API/library for general use alongside Californium, and then build a front-end client Android app to show live data published from a network of sensors through a broker to subscribed clients using the aforementioned API. 
The project is commissioned by the KTH Network Systems Laboratory. You can read more about it here: https://www.kth.se/cos/research/nslab

You can take a look at the IETS's RFC for CoAP publish-subscribe draft here: https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-core-coap-pubsub-08.txt

You can follow along our Project progress here: https://sites.google.com/view/team-multicast/home

You can see the repository for the Android app here: https://github.com/ihilal/Noisy

This library is meant to be used alongside The Californium Library.

## Available functionality:
- Discover: allows you to find a list of available topics on the broker
    - You may provide a query to limit the list you get back
    - If ```rt=core.ps``` is provided as a query, you can check whether the broker supports CoAP Publish-Subscribe
- Create: allows you to create a new topic on the broker with the given uri and name and content type
- Publish: allows you to publish content to the given uri of a topic on the broker
- Read: allows you to read the content on the specified topic uri
- Remove: allows you to remove a topic on the broker
- Subscription: given a topic uri and a listener (CoapHandler), it allows you to:
    - Subscribe to the given topic
    - Unsubscribe from the given topic
- Two classes available to help with using PubSub core functions using different styles:
    - Converter
    - Topic
    - check their documentation for how to use them

## Installation:

##Examples
```
PubSub pubsub = new PubSub("127.0.0.1"); 
OR
PubSub pubsub = new PubSub("127.0.0.1", 5683, 5000); 

CoapResponse response = pubsub.discover("rt=core.ps");

response = pubsub.create("topic", 40, "ps");
response = pubsub.create("topic1", 0, "ps/topic/");

response = pubsub.discover();

Set<WebLink> topics = Converter.getWebLinks(response);
OR
ArrayList<Topic> at = Topic.makeArrayList(LinkFormat.parse(response.getResponseText()));

response = pubsub.publish("content", 0, "ps/topic/topic1");

String content = pubsub.read("ps/topic/topic1").getResponseText();

CoapHandler handler = new CoapHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onLoad(CoapResponse coapResponse) {
        System.out.println("topic content: " + coapResponse.getResponseText());
    }

    @Override
    public void onError() {
        System.out.println("ERROR");
    }
};

PubSub.Subscription subscription = pubsub.new Subscription(handler, "ps/topic/topic1");

subscription.subscribe();

subscription.unsubscribe();

response = pubsub.remove("ps/topic/topic1");
```
