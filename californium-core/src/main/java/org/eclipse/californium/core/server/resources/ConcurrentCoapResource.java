/**
 * A ConcurrentCoapResource is an extension to a typical CoapResource and
 * defines its own {@link Executor}. Arriving request to this resource and to
 * child resources that do not define their own executor will be process by this
 * executor. This class can be used in particular if a resource and potentially
 * its children require a single-threaded environment. In this case, use a
 * ConcurrentCoapResource with a thread-pool of size 1 as parent and
 * CoapResource for all its children.
 * <p>
 * The following example server contains several resources that have different
 * multi-threading policies. The three resources on top with the name
 * "server-thread" are normal resources that do not define their own executor.
 * Therefore, they all use their parent's executor which ultimately is the
 * server's. The resource "single-threaded" defines its own executor with one
 * thread. Therefore, all requests to that resource will be executed by the same
 * one thread. Its child again is a single-threaded resource that uses its very
 * own single-threaded executor. The resource "four-threaded" uses an executor
 * with four threads. Request can be (concurrently) processed by any of them.
 * The resource has a child and a grand-child that both are normal resources and
 * therefore also use the executor with four threads. Finally, the resource
 * "mt-large" reuses a normal resource as implementation but uses a new executor
 * to process the requests. For the client, the resource behaves exactly like
 * there were no executor.
 * <pre>
 * CoapServer server = new CoapServer();
 * server.add(new CoapResource("server-thread")
 *   .add(new CoapResource("server-thread")
 *     .add(new CoapResource("server-thread"))));
 * server.add(new ConcurrentResource("single-threaded", 1)
 *   .add(new ConcurrentResource("single-threaded", 1)));
 * server.add(new ConcurrentResource("four-threaded", 4)
 *   .add(new CoapResource("same-as-parent")
 *     .add(new CoapResource("same-as-parent"))));
 * 
 * server.add(ConcurrentCoapResource.createConcurrentResourceBase(2, new LargeResource("large")));
 * server.start();
 * </pre>
 * The resulting resource three looks like the following
 * <pre>
 * Root
 *  |
 *  |-- server-thread: executed by pool-1 (server threads)
 *  |    `-- server-thread: executed by pool-1 (server threads)
 *  |         `-- server-thread: executed by pool-1 (server threads)
 *  |
 *  |-- single-threaded: executed by pool-2 (1 thread)
 *  |    `-- single-threaded: executed by pool-3 (1 thread)
 *  |
 *  |-- four-threaded: executed by pool-4 (4 threads)
 *  |    `-- same-as-parent: executed by pool-4 (4 threads)
 *  |         `-- same-as-parent: executed by pool-4 (4 threads)
 *  |
 *  |-- large: executed by pool-5 (2 threads)
