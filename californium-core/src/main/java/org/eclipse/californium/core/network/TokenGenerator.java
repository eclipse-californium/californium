	 * Intended to generate tokens with separate scopes for standard-,

	 * these tokens must be unique not only per remote peer. And due to the
	 * potential long term nature of observe tokens, these tokens are required
	 * to be maintained separated. Therefore the tokens must be generated in
	 * way, which ensures, that they have different values as the other tokens
	 * for standard-requests.
	 * 
	 * One idea of implementation would therefore be to set the token length
	 * different or to set bit 0 of byte 0 fix to 0 for standard and 1 for
	 * observe requests.
	 * 
	 * The caller must take care to use only unique tokens within the provided
	 * scope. In cases where the generated token is already in use, it's
	 * intended to create a next token calling this method again.
	 * 
	 * Note: the application may provide own tokens by calling
	 * {@link Request#setToken(Token)}. such tokens must also obey the scope
	 * rules of this generator. And it must be ensured, that these tokens are
	 * also unique according there scope.
