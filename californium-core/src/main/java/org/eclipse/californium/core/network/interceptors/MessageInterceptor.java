/**
 * MessageInterceptors register at an endpoint. When messages arrive from the
 * connector, the corresponding receive-method is called. When a message is
 * about to be sent over a connector, the corresponding send method is called.
 * The interceptor can be thought of being placed inside an <code>CoapEndpoint</code>
 * just between the message <code>Serializer</code> and the <code>Matcher</code>.
 * <p>
 * A <code>MessageInterceptor</code> can cancel a message to stop it. If it is
 * an outgoing message that traversed down through the <code>CoapStack</code> to the
 * <code>Matcher</code> and is now intercepted and canceled, will not reach the
 * <code>Connector</code>. If it is an incoming message coming from the
 * <code>Connector</code> to the <code>DataParser</code> and is now intercepted and
 * canceled, will not reach the <code>Matcher</code>.
