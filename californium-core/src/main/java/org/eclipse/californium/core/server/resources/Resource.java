/**
 * A resource is an element on the resource tree of a server. Resources are the
 * main building bricks to develop a CoAP server. A resource can have further
 * child resources that again can have children resulting in a tree data
 * structure. A resource must have a name and its URI is defined by the path to
 * the root of the server plus the name. Note that a resource's name is not part
 * of its path. Instead it holds that the URI is defined by
 * <tt>URI = path + name</tt> where the path is the concatenation of the names
 * of all parents separated and ended with a slash. Assume the following
 * resource tree
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Root
 *  |
 *  |-- foo
 *  |    `-- bar
 *  |         `-- bal
 * </pre>
 * 
 * For resource <tt>bal</tt> it holds that
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  bal.getName() equals "bal"
 *  bal.getPath() equals "/foo/bar/"
 *  bal.getURI()  equals "/foo/bar/bal"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A resource is able to respond to CoAP requests. The requests are contained in
 * an instance of type {@link Exchange} that contains additional information
 * about the current exchange. The request will always be a complete request and
 * not only a block as defined in the CoAP draft (<a
 * href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-block-12">
 * http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-block-12</a>)
 * </p><p>
 * When a request arrives at the server, the {@link ServerMessageDeliverer}
 * searches in the resource tree for the destination resource. It travels down
 * the resource tree by looking for one element of the destination URI after
 * another and by calling the method {@link #getChild(String)} on each element.
 * It is allowed to override this method and to return an arbitrary resource.
 * This allows for instance to serve URIs with wildcards or delegate requests to
 * any sub-URI to the same resource.
 * </p><p>
 * A resource can have its own {@link Executor}. If a resource has such an
 * executor, all requests will be handled by it. Otherwise, the request will
 * be executed on the executor of the parent or transitively the first ancestor
 * that defines its own executor. If no resource up to the root defines its own
 * executor, the currently executing thread will handle the request. A class
 * that implements this interface can export further methods to allow the
 * execution of code on the resource's executor. See {@link CoapResource} for an
 * example.
 * </p>
