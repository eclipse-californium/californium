 * Not called, if the connection is already established or the connector doesn't
 * require to establish a connection.</li>
 * <li>{@link #onDtlsRetransmission(int)} when a dtls handshake flight is retransmitted.</li>

 * (successfully)</li>
 * <li>{@link #onSendError(Throwable)} if the message cannot be sent</li>

 * The class that is interested in processing a message event either implements
 * this interface (and all the methods it contains) or extends the abstract
 * {@link MessageObserverAdapter} class (overriding only the methods of
 * interest).
 * <p>
 * The observer object created from that class is then registered with a message
 * using the message's {@link Message#addMessageObserver(MessageObserver)}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * Note: This class is unrelated to CoAP's observe relationship between an
 * endpoint and a resource. However, when a request establishes a CoAP observe
 * relationship to a resource which sends notifications, the method
 * {@link #onResponse(Response)} can be used to react to each such notification.
