/**
 * A layer processes requests, responses and empty messages. Layers can be
 * stacked upon each other to compose a processing stack.
 * <p>
 * When the {@link CoapEndpoint} receives a message, it forwards it to the
 * bottom layer by calling the corresponding receive-method. Each layer
 * processes the message and either forwards it to its upper layer or decides
 * not to. The uppermost layer forwards the message to the
 * {@link MessageDeliverer} which delivers the message to the server, e.g., a
 * request to the target resource or a response to the origin request.
 * <p>
 * When an {@link CoapEndpoint} sends a message, it forwards it to the uppermost
 * layer by calling the corresponding send-method. Each layer forwards the
 * message to its lower layer. The lowest layer forwards the message back to the
 * endpoint.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Exchange} contains all information concerning an exchange of a
 * request with a response. Layers access the exchange concurrently but in most
 * cases it is only possible for a single thread to be active on fields of the
 * exchange since we usually only deal with one request or one response at time
 * and duplicates are stopped to travel through the stack beforehand. If this is
 * not the case, however, synchronization is required.
 * <p>
 * Each layer should receive a {@link ScheduledExecutorService}. On this
 * executer, any task can be scheduled, e.g., retransmission. Many layers of
 * potentially many endpoints of potentially multiple servers can share the same
 * executor or have separate ones with different properties, e.g., size of
 * thread pool or priority of threads.
