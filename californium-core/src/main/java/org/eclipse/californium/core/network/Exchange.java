/**
 * An exchange represents the complete state of an exchange of one request and
 * one or more responses. The lifecycle of an exchange ends when either the last
 * response has arrived and is acknowledged, when a request or response has been
 * rejected from the remote endpoint, when the request has been canceled, or when
 * a request or response timed out, i.e., has reached the retransmission
 * limit without being acknowledged.
 * <p>
 * The framework internally uses the class Exchange to manage an exchange
 * of {@link Request}s and {@link Response}s. The Exchange only contains state,
 * no functionality. The CoAP Stack contains the functionality of the CoAP
 * protocol and modifies the exchange appropriately. The class Exchange and its
 * fields are <em>NOT</em> thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * The class {@link CoapExchange} provides the corresponding API for developers.
 * Proceed with caution when using this class directly, e.g., through
 * {@link CoapExchange#advanced()}.
 * <p>
 * This class might change with the implementation of CoAP extensions.
